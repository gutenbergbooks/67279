<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE HOLLOW TREE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Twinkle Toes lived with Uncle Mouser
in a little wee house in the woods,
and as he ran in and out in the twinkling
of an eye, every one called him
Twinkle Toes.</p>

<p>He liked to travel about and to meet
his friends, so on his second birthday,
Uncle Mouser gave him a fine new travelling
bag, with his initials upon it.</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes, like Uncle Mouser was
quite a story-teller. He liked to run about
in the woods at twilight and gather his
animal friends about him, and tell stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Most of all, however, he liked to travel
through the woods with his new travelling
bag.</p>

<p>One evening he started out through the
woods and ran on until he came to the
home of the THREE LITTLE KITTENS
WHO LOST THEIR MITTENS.</p>

<p>He rapped on the door, rap-a-tap-rap-a-tap.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens were at home,
and they cried in turn, “May I go? Ma,
may I go?”</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat opened the door
herself, and in waltzed Twinkle Toes with
his travelling bag.</p>

<p>They made him welcome you may be
sure, and Dot and Tot and Trot cried,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You’re a story-teller, we suppose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do tell us a story, Twinkle Toes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Twinkle Toes jumped right over
the travelling bag, with the letters “T-T”
upon it, and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To have a story you are bound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll see if any can be found!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He opened his travelling bag, and took
out another travelling bag, a little smaller.
He opened the second bag and took out
another, and another.</p>

<p>He gave each of the Three Little Kittens
a new travelling bag.</p>

<p>Each bag had the Kitten’s initials upon
it.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens were happy
you may be sure, and marched round and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
round the room with their new travelling
bags.</p>

<p>They begged for a story again, but
Twinkle Toes only said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Go off to bed with a skip and a run,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the travelling bag, our story’s begun.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens called, “Good
night Ma, good night Twinkle Toes,” and
they went merrily off to bed.</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes slept in Old Uncle
Mouser’s red plush-lined basket by the
fire.</p>

<p>Next morning the Three Little Kittens
begged to go with Twinkle Toes on a
journey.</p>

<p>Mother Kit-Cat said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dear Little Kittens you are so funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You may go—for the day is sunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed around trying to
catch his tail and the little bell, on the
little blue ribbon, round his neck went
tinkle, tinkle, tinkle!</p>

<p>They all started off merrily, the Three
Little Kittens singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’re Three Little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ve no need of mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Don’t be so sure of that,” whistled the
Wind, and before they got home it nipped
their ears and paws, and blew their long
whiskers!</p>

<p>Then Dot and Tot said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We were foolish Kittens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To leave off our mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="caption">CHIP, CHIP, CHIP, COME INTO OUR TREE</p>

<p>Brave Little Trot said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Always put your best foot out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Don’t think of things to cry about.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, they soon forgot that they
were cold, they soon forgot that they had
left their mittens at home.</p>

<p>They were wondering whom they would
visit, when they heard Three Little Curly-Tails
cry, “Chip, chip, chip, come into
our tree, come into our tree.”</p>

<p>Dot and Tot and Trot made their best
bow and said politely,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are Three Little Kittens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who once lost our mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed around and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am a friend whom everyone knows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My name is Little Twinkle Toes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>
<p>Old Mother Curly-Tail looked out from
her hole in the hollow tree, and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I give you invitation, hearty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To step inside and join our party.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even Twinkle Toes did not know how
a hollow tree looked inside.</p>

<p>They all scrambled into the tree and
Mother Curly-Tail said, “Hurry, hurry,
hurry.”</p>

<p>They helped for one hour and sixteen
minutes to store the Squirrels’ nuts away
for the winter.</p>

<p>Then, a surprise awaited them for
Mother Curly-Tail said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sing some verses if you’re able,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In will roll the chairs and table.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They sang a song, and in rolled a table
and chairs for them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>They climbed up into the chairs and
Mother Curly-Tail said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dishes will come if I don’t mistake it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a politeness lesson, if you’ll take it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In came the dishes, knives, forks, and
spoons, and they all jumped to their proper
places upon the table.</p>

<p>In came a kettle of food, smoking hot.</p>

<p>The Three Little Curly-Tails said, “Oh
Ma, please help our plates first, we are so
hungry.”</p>

<p>Mother Curly-Tail said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Visitors first, if you please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be polite, and do not tease.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Curly-Tails would not
wait, they were so hungry. They put their
paws in the kettle and burned them badly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="550" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE THREE LITTLE CHAIRS IN WHICH THEY SAT
TURNED ROUND</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” and “Ah,” they wailed.</p>

<p>The three little chairs in which they
sat turned round and remained with their
backs to the table.</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes and the Three Little Kittens
began to eat the food put on their
plates, saying “Thank you” and “If you
please,” politely.</p>

<p>By and by the three chairs, in which
the Three Little Curly-Tails sat, rolled back
into place, and they were given some sharp
nuts to crack with their sharp little teeth,
for by this time the food in the kettle
was all gone.</p>

<p>Dot wanted to tell the story of the lost
mittens and began, “One day when we
were sliding on the ice.”</p>

<p>At that very moment Mother Curly-Tail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
jumped down from her chair, and whispered
in the ear of each little Curly-Tail.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be polite to the Three Little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But don’t let them talk any more of their mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tot wanted to tell about finding the
mittens, so she began,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One day when we were sliding on the ice.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, oh,” cried the Curly-Tails, “Did
you lose your rubbers? Did you lose your
hoods? Did you lose your overshoes?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Trot, “We lost——”</p>

<p>At that very minute the Curly-Tails
cried, “Come out and climb, come out and
climb.”</p>

<p>No sooner said than done, they all ran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
out of the hollow tree and jumped from
branch to branch.</p>

<p>One after another cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come, follow me to the tallest tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is very exciting as you see.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By and by Twinkle Toes said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Back to mother everyone goes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When twilight comes, says Twinkle Toes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They all took up their little travelling
bags and started to run home through the
woods.</p>

<p>All at once they stopped still.</p>

<p>They said, “We forgot to say good bye,
we forgot our manners.”</p>

<p>Right about face, they all marched back
to the hollow tree and shouted,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To be polite, we all will try,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dear Little Curly-Tails, good bye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little Curly-Tails answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come again to have a play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call on us another day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat stood in the doorway
looking for them.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dear Little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You should wear your mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, their paws were cold as
cold could be.</p>

<p>Late that night Dot, and Tot, and Trot,
woke up and said, “We wonder why the
Curly-Tails did not want us to talk about
our mittens?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>Twinkle Toes called out sleepily from
Old Uncle Mouser’s red plush-lined basket,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Little Curly-Tails once wore the mittens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lost long ago, by Three Little Kittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I don’t know whether he knew what he
was talking about or whether he was talking
in his sleep.</p>

<p>He lay all curled up in the red, plush-lined
basket.</p>

<p>He was dreaming about a pair of Magic
Mittens that would always fit and never

<p>He said, “When will I get my Magic
Mittens?”</p>

</div>

<p>Twinkle Toes woke up early next
morning, and skipped about with his
travelling bag, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With travelling bag away he goes,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Let me go too, let me go too,” cried
the Three Little Kittens in one breath.</p>

<p>They all had their little travelling bags
with them and they shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To Squirrel Town away we go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three Little Kittens, ha, ha, ho, ho.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As it happened, they did not go to
Squirrel Town that day, nor the next, nor
the next, for Old Mother Kit-Cat said,
“Dot, Tot, Trot, you must earn some
money, so I can knit a pair of mittens
for Twinkle Toes.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat’s rocking chair
went to and fro, to and fro, and all this
time her needles went “click, click click.”</p>

<p>Dot and Tot said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh dear, oh dear, pray, what shall we do,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ll take my snow shovel, that’s what I’ll do,</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>
<p>“Hurrah, hurrah,” cried Dot and Tot,
“we will all take our snow shovels and
go to the woods and shovel paths for the
animals!”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed round and
round, and suddenly without warning,
down came a little snow shovel, and he
put it over his shoulder and marched
merrily along.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether it was a magic
snow shovel or not, but Twinkle Toes
worked three times as fast clearing paths
as the Three Little Kittens.</p>

<p>“My furry tail, how cold it is!” said
Dot.</p>

<p>“My long whiskers, how the wind
whistles,” said Tot.</p>

<p>Brave little Trot said,</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed round and round
while the Three Little Kittens shouted at
the top of their lungs in a sing-song way,</p>

<p>At this very minute, an astonishing

CLEARING PATHS</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>A great deep growly voice cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come shovel me out, you dear little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll give you pennies to buy wool for mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They were by old Curly-Bear’s den.</p>

<p>They were not a bit afraid.</p>

<p>They all went to work with a will and
shoveled a good path to the old Bear’s
den.</p>

<p>Then Curly-Bear reached out his paw
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When I heard Three Little Kittens sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I thought it was almost time for spring.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He handed Trot six pennies and went
back into his den for another nap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>“I wish we could sleep all winter,” said
Dot. Tot said, “I do miss my nice warm
mittens, why do I always forget to put
them on?”</p>

<p>“Overshoes too, overshoes too,” laughed
the wind as he whistled by.</p>

<p>They had all done enough shovelling of
snow that day, but next day they went to
the Ground Hog’s hole and he cried
sleepily,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come shovel me out, you dear little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll give you pennies to buy wool for mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They began to shovel with right good
will and all the while Old Shadow, the
Ground Hog was scolding about sunshine
and shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>He said he could never tell whether
or not he would cast his shadow until he
came out of his hole.</p>

<p>By and by he peeped out and gave
Trot the pennies, then he went back into
his hole for another nap.</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed round and round,
and the Three Little Kittens went on
until they heard a voice cry:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come shovel me out, you dear little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll give you pennies to buy wool for mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They went to the Beaver’s house built
by the pond and worked away, and will
you believe it, the Beaver said all the
time, “Work like a Beaver, work like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Beaver. Some day we may tell you how
we build our homes, but don’t come too
near, for we are very shy.”</p>

<p>The Beaver tossed six pennies out of
his window and called “Good bye” as the
Three Little Kittens trudged merrily down
the road.</p>

<p>“My shovel gets heavier every minute,”
said Dot.</p>

<p>“I cannot walk another step, I am most
frozen,” said Tot.</p>

<p>Brave Little Trot said, “We will keep
on a few steps more and maybe we will
meet some of our friends, or cousins, or
uncles, or aunts.”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed round and round.</p>

<p>Just then, was heard the “Jingle, jingle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
jingle,” of sleighbells. Some one was coming
in a sleigh.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens stood in the
road waving their snow shovels, and they
blocked the path.</p>

<p>The sleigh came nearer, and nearer,
every minute.</p>

<p>When Twinkle Toes saw who was in
the sleigh he set up a shout, “It is Old
Uncle Mouser, stop him, stop him.”</p>

<p>Uncle Mouser was pleased to see his
old friends you may be sure and he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Creep under my fur robe, as still as a mouse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then home we will ride to your own little house.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No sooner said than done, they all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
scrambled under the warm fur robe and
rode away, away, away, to the home of
the Three Little Kittens.</p>

<p>When they arrived Old Mother Kit-Cat
stood in the doorway looking for them.</p>

<p>She was delighted to see Uncle Mouser
again and he said he would stay, if he
could sleep in his red plush-lined basket.</p>

<p>Such a shaking of snow as there was
from fur and whiskers, and Trot gave Old
Mother Kit-Cat the pennies they had
earned.</p>

<p>When they were all ready to go to sleep
Dot said, “We forgot to ask Curly-Bear if
he had ever seen our mittens.”</p>

<p>Tot said, “We forgot to ask Old Shadow
if he had seen our mittens, that time they
were lost so long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Trot said, “Perhaps Billy Beaver could
have told us something about them.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hush, be still, ’tis time to sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three Little Kittens, quiet keep.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Twinkle Toes and Old Mouser were already
asleep.</p>

<p>They lay side by side in the red plush-lined
basket.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat had already started
a pair of mittens for Twinkle Toes, but she
needed yarn to finish them.</p>

<p>She said, “I will send the Three Little
Kittens for yarn to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She was not at all sleepy, so she thought
she would finish one of the mittens she
had started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>She took up her needles, and to her
surprise, they went to and fro, to and fro,
in her paws and in less than a twinkling
of an eye, one mitten was finished.</p>

<p>“By my furry tail,” said Mother Kit-Cat,
that must be a magic mitten after all.
“Perhaps this is one of the magic mittens
Twinkle Toes has been talking about.”</p>

<p>Then, to her surprise the finished mitten
began to sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When you do good deeds for others,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fathers, sisters, cousins, mothers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even helpful things for kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You may wear some magic mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat was not sure
whether she was asleep or dreaming, for
all the rest of the family had gone to
dreamland.</p>

<span class="smaller">UNCLE MOUSER’S STORY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The next day passed very quickly, for
the Three Little Kittens went to town
to buy yarn for mittens for Twinkle Toes.</p>

<p>When evening came, they all sat round
the fire and the Three Little Kittens
danced up and down before Uncle Mouser,
and Twinkle Toes danced round and round.</p>

<p>They all said, “Please tell us a story.”</p>

<p>Uncle Mouser answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will tell you a story in prose and rhyme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I make up stories just half my time.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens danced up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
down and cried, “Tell us a true story, tell
us something that really, truly happened.”</p>

<p>Uncle Mouser rocked to and fro, to
and fro, in the little rocking chair and
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I would not like to see you in tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So I’ll think back for several years.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh Uncle Mouser, oh Uncle Mouser,”
cried the Three Little Kittens, “we cannot
wait years and years for a story.”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed round and round.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat’s needles went
“click, click, click.”</p>

<p>By and by Old Uncle Mouser said, “By
my whiskers, I do know one true story
about a little kitten, who liked to wash
dishes, and do kitchen work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat stopped knitting
suddenly, and leaned forward and her eyes
grew as big as saucers.</p>

<p>She said, “Did you say, liked to wash
dishes and do kitchen work?”</p>

<p>Old Uncle Mouser answered, “I will tell
you the story as it was told me by my
old Aunt Tabby.” Then he began.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the Old Man of the
Fire said to the King, “I wonder if any
kitten in the world likes to wash dishes
and do kitchen work?”</p>

<p>The King said, it could not be possible
that any kitten liked to do these
things, so the Little Old Man of the Fire
said, “I travel everywhere over hill and
dale, and wherever a fire is, there am I.
What will you give me if I find a kitten
who likes to do kitchen work?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p class="caption">ONCE UPON A TIME THE OLD MAN OF THE FIRE

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>The King replied, “I will give you a
thousand miles of sun to burn morning
and evening.”</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire ran
over hill and dale singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am the Little Old Man of the Fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ha, ha, I am happy, I never tire.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>My! what a long search he had.</p>

<p>He found plenty of kittens who hated
to do kitchen work, and he was afraid they
all hated to wash dishes.</p>

<p>He was about to give up the search,
when one night he saw a light on a far
hill, twinkle, twinkle.</p>

<p>He followed the light and soon came
to a little wee house on the hill.</p>

<p>A little Kitten was singing,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pile the dishes up higher, higher,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Of kitchen work I never tire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pile the dishes up higher, higher.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dishes were piled up to the ceiling.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire was
so happy, he danced with glee.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire rapped
on the door and the kitten called, “Come
in.”</p>

<p>The Little Old Man stepped inside, and
for the first time in four and twenty hours,
the little Kitten stopped work.</p>

<p>Her gingham apron changed to an
apron of gold.</p>

<p>Her white cap changed to a gold crown.</p>

<p>She became a real Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>She had been under a spell until the
Little Old Man of the Fire came in.</p>

<p>They joined hands and ran merrily
over hill and dale singing all the way.</p>

<p>When the King saw the Princess he
ordered a great wedding, and made her
Queen, and he gave the Little Old Man of
the Fire miles and miles of sky to burn
every night.</p>

<p>One day, long after that, the King
asked the Queen “How did you happen
to like to work?” and she answered, “I
said to myself,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I try to like the work I do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some day my wishes will come true.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The King said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If we try to like our work,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I’m sure we’ll never shirk.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>
<p>The King and Queen looked out at the
evening sky, and they knew the Little Old
Man of the Fire was at work, for they saw
a very beautiful sunset.</p>

<p>The story was ended.</p>

<p>Uncle Mouser rocked to and fro.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat said, as her needles
flew to and fro, “That does not sound like
a true story to me, it sounds to my old
ears like a Fairy Tale.”</p>

<p>Uncle Mouser replied, “I can only tell
the story as Aunt Tabby told it to me.”</p>

<p>If you guessed yesterday, and to-day,
and to-morrow, you could not guess what
happened next.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens slipped out of
their three little rocking-chairs and went
“pit-a-pat,” into the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>Twinkle Toes followed them waltzing

<p>They began to wash dishes.</p>

<p>Splash, splash, went the water.</p>

<p>Clatter, clatter went the supper dishes

<p>On Ground-Hog day in February,
Dot cried, “Oh, Ma, may we go to
visit Old Shadow, the Ground-Hog?”</p>

<p>Tot cried, “Oh, Ma, may we go out
with our little travelling bags?”</p>

<p>Trot stood first on one foot, then on
the other, and said, “Ma cannot hear herself
think if we all talk at once.”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes said, “I think we can all
take our travelling bags.”</p>

<p>Mother Kit-Cat looked severely at the
Three Little Kittens and said, “You may
go, if you will only remember to wear
your mittens.”</p>

<p class="caption">IT GREW DARKER AND DARKER IN OLD

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“Mittens, mittens, I will wear my magic
mittens,” said Twinkle Toes.</p>

<p>By this time Mother Kit-Cat had finished
the mittens for Twinkle Toes.</p>

<p>He put on his mittens and the Three
Little Kittens all put on theirs, and followed
Twinkle Toes with a hop and a skip
and a bound.</p>

<p>It was a cold day in February, and the
wind was blowing.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dot, and Tot and Trot cried,
“We are tired, we wish we were at our
journey’s end.”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes rubbed his mittens together
and said, “I wish we were at Old
Shadow’s hole.”</p>

<p>Then the funniest thing happened.</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye, they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
at Old Shadow’s hole, and there he was,
busily digging.</p>

<p>He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Three Little Kittens I’m glad you came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But old Woodchuck is my real name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now if “Old Shadow” you like better,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call me that to the very letter.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then he caught sight of Twinkle
Toes and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is a friend that everyone knows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our dear little, queer little Twinkle Toes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens made a bow
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Shadow, answer the Three Little Kittens,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did you ever wear our three pairs of mittens?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At that, the strangest thing happened,
Old Shadow ran into his hole calling,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You speak of mittens, you scare me so,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I do not know which way to go.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Kittens all ran after him.</p>

<p>The hole was funnel-shaped, and the
passage-way grew smaller, and smaller, and
smaller, and wound in and out.</p>

<p>By and by they saw Old Shadow at the
far end, and he called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come inside, and take your ease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But don’t disturb my digging, please.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By and by he stopped digging, and said,
“Ha, ha, ha, let us measure whiskers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>He had very long whiskers and was
proud of them.</p>

<p>“Come, help me dig, for we may then
find some clover roots. How I do like
clover roots!”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed round and round
and then began to dig with a will, to
please Old Shadow.</p>

<p>Dot soon said, “I must stop, for my
paws are tired.”</p>

<p>Tot said, “Oh dear, my paws were not
made for digging.”</p>

<p>Trot said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“We are Three Little Kittens,</div>

</div>

<p>At the mention of the word, “mittens,”
the most remarkable thing happened.</p>

<p>Old Shadow took out his watch and
cried, “It is quarter to spring, it is quarter
to spring. I must hurry, hurry, hurry
or I will be too late to meet Lady Spring.”</p>

<p>Whisk! bound! He was out of his burrow
before you could wink an eye lash!</p>

<p>It was dark in the strange burrow, and
Twinkle Toes and the Three Little Kittens
ran this way, and that way, trying to find
the way out.</p>

<p>The burrow had several rooms and they
kept losing themselves every few minutes.</p>

<p>They could always hear the tinkle,
tinkle, tinkle of the little bell that hung
from Twinkle Toes’ neck.</p>

<p>Dot and Tot began to cry, but brave
little Trot said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cheer up, kittens do not cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s a way out, if you but try.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>It grew darker and darker in Old
Shadow’s burrow, and I don’t know what
in the world they would have done, if
Twinkle Toes had not thought of his Magic
Mittens.</p>

<p>He thought of his mittens, and rubbed
them gently saying, “I wish the Little Old
Man of the Fire would appear.”</p>

<p>No sooner said, than done.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire appeared
in his green cap and jacket of yellow.</p>

<p>His jacket shone with light and he
sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, I can’t help but sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is planting time, and almost spring.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>
<p>“Not in February,” said Dot.</p>

<p>“Not in February,” said Tot.</p>

<p>Brave little Trot said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t be alarmed Sir, we’re only kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who once on a time lost all our mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Twinkle Toes said never a word, but
his little bell went, “tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,”
every step he took.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire said,
“I came upon you so suddenly, you almost
scared me out of a year’s growth.</p>

<p>“I see Twinkle Toes, and Three Little
Kittens, big as life and half as natural.
Ho, ho, so you do not think it is time for
spring? Look above you, see the roots
growing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>Dot said, “Please show us the way out.”</p>

<p>Tot said, “We are afraid of the dark,
lead the way out.”</p>

<p>Brave Little Trot said, “We will do a
kindness for you, kind Sir, if you will
light us home.”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes waltzed round and round.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire was
full of mischief and he said</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Once or twice most every year,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I naturally just disappear,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">They are light enough for you and me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Without another word the Little Old
Man of the Fire disappeared.</p>

<p>Dot and Tot began to cry softly into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
their little pocket handkerchiefs and even
Trot got his little pocket handkerchief out,
but Twinkle Toes waltzed round and
round.</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A misfortune is often what we make it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hark! to footsteps, I don’t mistake it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he rubbed his Magic Mittens and
wished for Uncle Mouser.</p>

<p>They all listened.</p>

<p>For steps were coming nearer, and nearer
every minute.</p>

<p>Uncle Mouser appeared at the opening
of the burrow with the Little Old Man of
the Fire, whom he had caught, and now
carried inside a lantern!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Uncle Mouser shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Have you seen three Kittens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who once lost their mittens?</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">There’s a bell that tinkles wherever he goes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They all shouted, “Hurrah Uncle Mouser,
here we are, here we are!”</p>

<p>They lost no time getting out of Old
Shadow’s burrow you may be sure, and
the Little Old Man of the Fire hopped
merrily about in the lantern singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It is fun away to roam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But there is no place like home!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Uncle Mouser said, “It is not safe to
go into deep burrows. Let me count, are
you all here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>Twinkle Toes and the Three Little
Kittens were so pleased to see Uncle
Mouser, they hugged and kissed him so
hard, and jumped about so much, he could
not count them to save his life.</p>

<p>He kept saying anxiously, “I hope I
have you all here, two, three, or four.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat stood in the doorway
looking for them and she said, “Oh
Uncle Mouser, your red plush-lined basket
is waiting for you.”</p>

<p>She hugged and kissed Twinkle Toes,
and the Three Little Kittens and gave
them some milk, and put them to bed.</p>

<p>They talked a good deal in their sleep
that night and Twinkle Toes said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With travelling bags now we have found,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>

    <div class="verse indent0">But very happy are the kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because I wore my Magic Mittens!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Magic Mittens were very busy that
night, they dusted everything in Twinkle
Toes’ room. They said in a sing-song kind
of way.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You may know some things about Three Kittens,</div>

</div>

<p>Uncle Mouser and Twinkle Toes went
home next day, and the Three Little
Kittens called “Good bye, good bye, good
bye, come again soon to visit us.”</p>

<p>“Clip, clip, clip,” went Old Uncle Mouser’s
cane as he went down the path.</p>

<p>He called back, “I will come again, if
I may sleep in my red plush-lined basket.”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes went off waving his Magic
Mittens and he waltzed round and round.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat put on her sun-bonnet
and took her market basket and
went to town.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens wanted to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
out sliding on the ice, but Mother Kit-Cat
had told them they must keep house while
she was gone.</p>

<p>It was very quiet in the house with
company gone.</p>

<p>It was very lonesome with Mother Kit-Cat
away.</p>

<p>They missed Twinkle Toes and said,
“How we do wish Twinkle Toes would
come back.”</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire suggested,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Three Little Kittens I think you’d better</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sit right down and compose a letter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ask him to come back, wherever he goes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your queer little, dear little, Twinkle Toes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>
<p>The Three Little Kittens did not know
much about letter writing, but they thought
they would write a letter to Twinkle Toes
and drop it in the first mail that went
out.</p>

<p>They were going to ask him to come
back and visit them.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens drew their
three little stools up to the table, and
they got out pen, paper and ink.</p>

<p>Dot cried, “Oh, oh, oh, my pretty
white fur.”</p>

<p>Tot cried, “I am drowning in ink.”</p>

<p>Trot cried, “Help, help.”</p>

<p>Now what do you suppose had happened?</p>

<p>They had upset the bottle of ink and it
had splashed over their fur and whiskers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
The Little Old Man of the Fire cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Get a tub and rub-a-dub,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Get one this minute and put kittens in it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens were not fond
of a bath, but they got water and filled
the tub and jumped in.</p>

<p>Such a rubbing and scrubbing you
never saw.</p>

<p>Soon they were out and drying by the
fire.</p>

<p>They sat down to start their letter over
again when the Little Old Man of the Fire
cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For shame, you left a dirty tub,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go clean it now, go rub and scrub.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They got cloths and tumbled into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
tub, head-first and began to rub and scrub,
until they had it clean.</p>

<p>They were so tired that Dot and Tot
sat down then by the table, and began to
cry until they had cried a little stream of
water, but Trot said, “Will you cry a bowl
full? Will you cry a tub full?”</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire sputtered
again and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis pleasanter anyway, I think,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To write with pencil instead of ink!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At that very minute three little pencils
sailed right down into the paws of the
Three Little Kittens.</p>

<p>They did not write that letter that day.</p>

<p>They did not write that letter the next
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>They did not write that letter at all,
for “rap a tap,” sounded on the door, and
Twinkle Toes and Uncle Mouser appeared,
Old Mother Kit-Cat right behind them.</p>

<p>They said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t say you feel afraid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come out and join the big parade.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, there was a big parade,
and all the animals were marching, right
foot, left foot.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens lost no time
joining them, you may be sure.</p>

<p>Because many of the animals had flags,
they cried, “Oh we wish we had a flag
too.”</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes did not think of his
Magic Mittens that minute, they were all
so excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>They marched a mile through the
woods and back again, and went with a
hop, and a skip, and a bound, back to
their little wee house at the edge of the
woods.</p>

<p>To their surprise they found Old Mother
Kit-Cat had gotten back ahead of them,
and there she sat rocking to and fro crying,
“Oh dear, oh dear.”</p>

<p>“Get the doctor,” shouted Uncle Mouser.</p>

<p>Twinkle Toes said, “Get the camphor.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat rocked to and fro,
crying, “Oh me, oh my.”</p>

<p>Dot and Tot said, “What is the matter,
Ma.”</p>

<p>Trot said, “I believe she wanted to
march beneath her own flag of red, white
and blue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’re too poor to buy a banner ’tis true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We have no banner of red, white and blue.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At that very minute Twinkle Toes
thought of his Magic Mittens, and he
wished that every one of their little travelling
bags might be full of red, white, and
blue bunting.</p>

<p>“Snip-snap,” they unclasped their little
travelling bags.</p>

<p>Out rolled yards and yards of bunting.</p>

<p>The bunting was red, white and blue.</p>

<p>Uncle Mouser said, “Thirteen stripes
and forty-eight stars.”</p>

<p>They begged him to tell a story about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the flag, but he only said again, adding a
line to make a real verse,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thirteen stripes and forty-eight stars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, make this glorious flag of ours.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell it,
Old Uncle Mouser and Mother Kit-Cat, and
Twinkle Toes, were measuring the bunting
to make a great big flag.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens got scissors
that went “snip, snip, snip.”</p>

<p>Now what do you suppose they were
doing?</p>

<p>They were making a flag of red, white,
and blue.</p>

<p>They were making a flag to wave outside
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire was so
happy he kept singing patriotic verses over
and over,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hurrah for the flag and our country too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurrah for the flag red, white, and blue.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They cut out white stars and sewed
them to the field of blue.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’re true to the colors, the flag is ours,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thirteen stripes and forty-eight stars.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the flag was finished the Three
Little Kittens begged to take it out and
Mother Kit-Cat said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I must say “yes,” for you’ll beg any way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To carry this flag for a year and a day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Twinkle Toes marched ahead of the
Three Little Kittens and they took turns
carrying the flag.</p>

<p>All the animals bowed to them as they
passed, and saluted the flag.</p>

<p>When they got home again Old Mouser
told them stories about the flag as Twinkle
Toes waved it to and fro.</p>

<p>They all sang a little song that you can
sing to the tune of “Lightly Row.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bring the flag, bring the flag,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wave it ever high above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bring the flag, bring the flag,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flag that we all love,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bonnie red, and white and blue,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Bring the flag, bring the flag,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wave it high above.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When night came, the Three Little
Kittens dreamed that they were sailing
away in a sailboat with Uncle Mouser and
Twinkle Toes, and that the sailboat had a
sail like our flag red, white, and blue.</p>

<p>They thought that Mother Kit-Cat stood
in the doorway to bid them good bye, and
that Uncle Mouser said he would come
again if his red plush-lined basket was
waiting for him.</p>

<p>If you close your eyes you may join
them too and sail away, away, away.</p>

<p>You may even hear the bell that
Twinkle Toes wears “tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>I can hear the little bell sing,</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
